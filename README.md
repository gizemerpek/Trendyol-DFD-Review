# Trendyol-DFD-Review

In this article, we examined the data flows in Trendyol, an online shopping application. 
While doing this, we used DFDs. Thanks to DFDs, we saw with graphics how the application 
user, the vendors in the application and the system work and how they communicate with 
each other. The DFDs we create continue from the user's entry into the system to the delivery 
of the product to the seller's hand, until the seller enters the product into the system and sells 
the product. As a result of this article, we realized the importance of DFDs in understanding 
the functioning of the system. By visualizing the system, we made an abstract algorithm more 
understandable. We found that a project developer who uses DFDs will find it easier to see 
possible deficiencies in the project and will have more information about the requirements of 
the project.
